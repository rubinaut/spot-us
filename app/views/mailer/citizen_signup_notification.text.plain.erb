<%= SITE_NAME%> is yours to shape (including your profile: <%=myspot_profile_url%>)

Our goal is to make sure that reporters cover the issues that are
important to you. The best way to make this happen is to....

1. Suggest a Story: This lets our reporters know what is important to you.

2. Fund a pitch: Perhaps our reporters have already created a pitch that
would be of interest to you. Your donation could turn it into a reality.
Check out our action items here: <%=news_items_url%>

3. Pick up an Assignment: Some pitches have assignments where you can help
out with the reporting by donating time. Search through our reporting
projects here: <%=news_items_url%>

If you have any questions – don’t hesitate to contact <%= SITE_NAME%>: <%=APP_CONFIG[:email_notifications][:info][:email]%>

We are very hands on and passionate about making sure that the
information needs of our communities are met. We work for you!!!!

Sincerely,
The <%= SITE_NAME %> Team
